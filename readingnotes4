This is a good visual layout of the organization trouble-shooting requires when assessing a technical issue. The process is one I learned early as a child playing on the home computer--why did that break? How did I break it? Why does that fix work here and not there? In the end, itâ€™s ultimately the scientific method whereby we establish hypotheses, test them, and arrive at a theory for a solution. Then, implementing the solution either works or it does not, and the ultimate arbiter will be the consumer/end user.
