Signs of malware:
Slower than usual performance
Pop-up spates
Other anomalies

Entering Safe Mode:
Disconnect the PC from the Internet until you are certain it is safe to do so again.
Boot into Safe Mode to force Windows into a minimal state
Windows 10 Route to restarting in Safe Mode:
“To boot into Windows Safe Mode, first click the Start button in Windows 10 and select the Power button as if you were going to reboot, but don’t click anything.
Next hold down the Shift key and click Reboot. When the full-screen menu appears, select Troubleshooting, then Advanced Options, then Startup Settings.
On the next window click the Restart button and wait for the next screen to appear (just stick with us here, we know this is long). 
Next you will see a menu with numbered startup options; select number 4, which is Safe Mode. Note that if you want to connect to any online scanners you’ll need to select option 5, which is Safe Mode with Networking.”

Delete Temporary Files using Disk Cleanup.

Using a malware scanner program--since the extant Antivirus didn’t detect the malware. 

I would not use anything by a Russian firm/national or Chinese firm/national to check my computer for malware as they’re behavior is clearly antithetical to US security as shown in the recent Solarwinds fiasco.

Finally, if the problems persist after one scan, try other programs and scans as they may be equipped to deal with the malware in question.
