Importance and Challenge: Communicating important procedures for completion of tasks within the mission of the client.

Policy. Answers “Why?” Provides broad, overarching guidance.
SOP. Answers “What, when, and why.” What needs to be done, when does it need to be done, and why is it being done. There may be multiple SOPs that support a specific policy.
Work Instructions. Answers “How.” A work instruction (WI) provides the step-by-step directions for accomplishing a particular task. There may be multiple sets of work instructions that support a specific SOP.

Without prepared responses for organizational procedures, efficiencies can be undermined, best practices underutilized, and client/customer data risk exposure increases. Because each organization has unique technological environments, it is important to be flexible in design since what works in one context does not necessarily work in another. Given the moving trends in security vulnerability, maintaining an up-to-date SOP contributes to the challenge of writing it, since the writing is constant under edit and revision.

Make sure it is readable/consumable, understandable, actionable, measurable

Plan by outlining procedures, balance the detail for each stage and know the flow of operations; seek to compile steps for efficiency

Cover with summary: “briefly describes the topic of the SOP, inputs, output, expected results, and involved roles”

Guiding Principles:
Keep it simple

Tell visual stories with flowcharts 
Brand your SOPs with consistency
Write for the audience
