Getting started with Github provides an overview of the features and functionality of the site at-large. This will be a good bookmark for sourcing new concepts in Github as I proceed to develop my understanding. Though a space for coders, the mission of Github seeks to obliviate the image of the isolated coder in favor of the social coder. There seems to be an enormous gap in technology geeks making the connection they need to understand humans if they want to solve tasks for them! I used this source to print out hard copies of the Git Cheat Sheet and these have proved super helpful for reference and additional note-taking for using Ubuntu Server Edition synchronization. Some other early favorites include:
https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/git-and-github-learning-resources 
As well as the entire Explore section since this is the space to look at for navigating towards socializing in the community.

I found the introductory videos served nicely as pre-lecture watching. I find the overall site to be somewhat annoying since its usefulness somewhat ends there. There is a Learn section, but it too is a bit more on the “saying-” rather than “showing and doing-” front. In other words, I find myself querying outside of the site for uses.
